title: Workshop "Continuous Delivery on the Kubernetes Plattform" at microXchg 2017
---
On February 16th, I will give a [workshop at microXchg 2017 about "Continuous Delivery on the Kubernetes Platform"](http://sched.co/93vH). During this talk we will build a continuous delivery pipeline on kubernetes using the tools mentioned in the abstract. The code will be published step-by-step during the event on a [github repository](https://github.com/nbyl/cd-workshop-demo). You will have the chance to follow the pipeline on your device during the talk.

 As there will be limited internet bandwidth at the location, I have already published the first lab where we will setup kubernetes and jenkins. If you have already done this before the talk, you will already have done the major downloads. Afterwards the demo will be able to operate on a smaller bandwidth connection.

  If you have any questions beforehand, feel free to [contact me](https://about.me/nicolasbyl).
